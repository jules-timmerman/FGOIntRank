# Concept

This is a small program that parse JSON data from Atlas Institute and allows for some analysis the data.

# How to use

You can execute the program with the following : 
```bash
python main.py
```

You are then guided by input numbers through the menus

If you are knowledgeable in Python, you may add your own functions in `main.py` by using the `servants` list (mainly).

This branch for retro-compatibility was tested with python 3.5.3 

# Quick Disclaimer

I don't know if it is really a disclaimer but this is simply a small program I did for me to use. You can obviously use it but it wasn't really intended to be distributed so it might be a bit weird to use. I might do a proper version one day
